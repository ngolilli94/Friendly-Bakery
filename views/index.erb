    <h3>April Rain Song</h3>
    <h4>Langston Hughes</h4>
    Let the rain kiss you.<br>
    Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.<br>
    Let the rain sing you a lullaby.<br>
    <br>
    The rain makes still pools on the sidewalk.<br>
    The rain makes running pools in the gutter.<br>
    The rain plays a little sleep-song on our roof at nightâ€”<br>
    <br>
    And I love the rain.<br>
    </p>
